# Halloween
See root README for overall application description.

This is written for Android OS 11 (SDK 30) using a device with the front camera available.

Device must support:
- Android OS 11
- Front Camera
- TTS Enabled and language packs downloaded.

This is the original version and was written with a deadline (Halloween) - so it's a little dirty in some places.


## Todo
- Tests
- Clean up permissions
- Better handling of installed languages
- Load pocketsphinx terms from JSON definitions rather than predefined grammar files and link tasks for execution based on spoken commands
- Better error handling
- Better logging
- More data driven in general - define wait time for "GREETING" - define what "GREETING" is in task "pack" etc.
- Better UI handling - look into LiveData usage
